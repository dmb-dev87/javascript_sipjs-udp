# SIP.js UDP Implementation
This project is very young and doesn't have much support as of yet. This was a P.O.C. for one of my test applications and works pretty good. This version of SIP.js just replaces the WebSocket transport with the UDP transport.

### Install SIP.js UDP
```
npm install sipjs-udp
```

#### Examples
See the `examples` folder for implementation.

#### Questions/Bug Reporting
Please open up an issue if you have a question or find a bug. I try my best to be proactive and will try to resolve issues quickly. Thanks!
